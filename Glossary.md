**Electrical Contacts**, also known as contact pads, are large square areas of conductive material allowing for easy acces to measure electrical properties.

**Conductive Traces** are long, continuous, lengths of conductive filament which allow current to pass through. Conductive traces act as sensing elements and to connect electrical contacts thereby forming a complete electrical circuits.

**Sensing Element** is any electrically conductive element that can be used to measure a specific mechanical or environmental property, such as force or temperature. 

**Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)** is a 3D printing process wherein plastic filaments are heated and extruded through a dispensing nozzle. Three dimensional objects are printed onto a print bed in a layer-by-layer process. FDM is by far the most common and cheapest style of 3D printers.

**Polylactic Acid (PLA)** is a plastic that is commonly used in 3D printing. PLA based plastics are used for the structural and conductive components of all sensors described in this manual.

**Polyvinyl Acetate (PVA)** is a water-soluble plastic commonly used in 3D printing to produce temporary support structures. This material is often used to improve the print quality of difficult to print objects.

**Calibration** includes a set of methods and tools to compare the results of a sensor to a calibration standard of known accuracy. For purposes of this manual, the term calibration is used to describe the process of converting a change in a measured electrical property (resistance or capacitance) to a mechanical or envrionmental property (force, acceleration, or temperature) depending on the sensor.

**Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** converts an analog signal to a digital signal. The output of the sensors described in this manual are analog, and therefore must be converted to a digital signal by an ADC, prior to being read by a microcontroller.

**Analog Signal** is a continuous signal. In other words, an analog signal is any signal that can take any value between the signal's minum and maximum value.

**Digital Signal** is a signal that can only take specific, or discrete, values. All computers, including microcontrollers, can only read from or create a digital signal and not an analog signal. 

**Infill pattern** defines the shape and structure of the inside of a 3D printed part. Infill pattern affects the amount of material used, as well as a printed parts strength and weight. 

**Cantilever beam** is any beam or rod that is fixed to a wall or surface on one end and is free, or unsupported, at the other end.

**Proof mass** is a weight of known mass used in measurement equipment. Accelerometers typically use a relatively heavy proof mass to obtain a better measurement of applied acceleration.
