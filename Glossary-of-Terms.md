# Glossary of Terms #

An **Analog Signal** is a continuously-valued signal. In other words, an analog signal is any signal that can take any value between the signal's minimum and maximum value.

An **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** converts an analog signal to a digital signal. The output of the sensors described in this manual are analog, and therefore must be converted to a digital signal by an ADC, such as that within many microcontrollers, prior to being used by its onboard software.

**Calibration** includes a set of methods and tools to compare the results of a sensor to a calibration standard of known accuracy. For the purposes of this manual, the term is used to describe the process of converting a change in a measured electrical property (resistance or capacitance) to a mechanical or environmental property (force, acceleration, temperature, etc.) depending on the sensor.

A **Cantilever Beam** is any beam (or rod) that is fixed to a wall or surface on one end and is 'free' (unsupported) at its other end.

The **Conductive Traces** are long continuous lengths of conductive filament which allow current to pass through. They act as *sensing elements* (see below) and to connect electrical contacts to complete an electrical circuit.

A **Digital Signal** is a signal that can only take specific (discrete) values. All computers -- including the microprocessor onboard a microcontroller -- can only read from (or create) a digital signal and not an analog signal.

**Electrical Contacts**, also called contact pads, are large rectangular areas of conductive material allowing easy access for measuring electrical properties.

**Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)** is a 3D printing process wherein plastic filaments are heated and extruded through a dispensing nozzle. 3D objects are printed onto a *print bed* or *build plate* in a layer-by-layer process. 3D printers using FDM are by far the most common and least expensive.

The **Infill Pattern** defines the shape and structure of the inside of a 3D printed part. Infill pattern affects the amount of material used as well as a printed part's strength and weight.

**Polylactic Acid (PLA)** is a plastic commonly used in 3D printing. PLA-based plastics are used for the structural and conductive components of all sensors described in this manual.

**Polyvinyl Acetate (PVA)** is a water-soluble plastic commonly used in 3D printing to produce temporary support structures. This material is often used to improve the print quality of difficult-to-print objects.

A **Proof Mass** is a weight of known mass used in measurement equipment. Accelerometers typically use a relatively heavy proof mass to obtain a better measurement of applied acceleration.

A **Sensing Element** is any electrically conductive element that can be used to measure a specific mechanical or environmental property, such as force or temperature.

**Sensitivity**, when used to describe a sensor, is the ratio of an output signal of a sensor and the measured property. In other words, a more sensitive force sensor has a larger change in resistance for a given applied force. More sensitive sensors can readily detect smaller changes in the measured property (for example, force) than a less sensitive one.
