# Preliminary List of Equipment and Materials
    
 -  A [3D printer](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/3d-printers/943?s=N4IgTCBcDaIMwBMAEAHATgSwHYBcQF0BfIA).
    
    Minimum requirements:
    
     -  A 3D printer with two extruders ("dual extrusion" capability), to print both regular and conductive material.
    
    Recommended: 
    
     -  A *cartesian* 3D printer (as opposed to a *delta* 3D printer), to make printing more consistent throughout the *print volume* and easier to predict in general.
    
    Nice-to-have's:
    
     -  A 3D printer with even more than two extruders <!--(?)-->, to also print "breakaway" or dissolvable material for 'scaffolding' prints above the *build plate*.
        
     -  An [Ultimaker-brand 3D printer](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers).* All Ultimaker-brand 3D printers are cartesian 3D printers.
        
         -  An [*Ultimaker 3* (or *Ultimaker 3 Extended*)](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers/ultimaker-3), as used in our project development.
         -  An [*Ultimaker S3*](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers/ultimaker-s3), the successor to the *Ultimaker 3*.
        
     -  More than one 3D printer:
        
         -  More than one of the same make & model, to more quickly test print settings, test designs, and create complete devices -- get up and running faster.
         -  More than one of different models, to try them out and similarly get up and running faster at the cost of less consistency and predictability.
    
 -  A spool of regular [3D printing filament](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/3d-printing-filaments/944), preferably just [250 grams](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/3d-printing-filaments/944?s=N4IgjCBcoExh0QGMoDMCGAbAzgUwDQgD2UA2iDAOxgAMNIAuoQA4AuUIAyqwE4CWAOwDmIAL7igA) for sensor structures, or to start with for large albeit partially-hollow prints.
    
     -  [Easy-to-Print 3D Printer Filaments ](https://www.mcmaster.com/3d-printer-filaments/easy-to-print-3d-printer-filaments-5/)
     -  [Flexible 3D Printer Filaments ](https://www.mcmaster.com/3d-printer-filaments/flexible-3d-printer-filaments-5/)
    
 -  A spool of conductive 3D printing filament (e.g., [500 grams of *LulzBot*-brand black 2.85-mm PLA](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/lulzbot/RM-PL0100/8605417?s=N4IgjCBcoKxaBjKAzAhgGwM4FMA0IB7KAbRAGYyAmAdgE4AOEfCy%2BgBmpAF18AHAFyggAyvwBOASwB2AcxABffAFpK8EEkjiArnkIkQcLopBKyajdt1FIpMG27zHQA)), preferably just 250 grams, which is more than enough.
    
     -  [Conductive Easy-to-Print 3D Printer Filaments ](https://www.mcmaster.com/3d-printer-filaments/conductive-easy-to-print-3d-printer-filaments/)
     -  [Conductive Flexible 3D Printer Filaments](https://www.mcmaster.com/3d-printer-filaments/conductive-flexible-3d-printer-filaments/)
    
 -  Nice-to-have: A spool of "breakaway" or [dissolvable 3D printing filament](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/polymaker/PM70810/13146566?s=N4IgjCBcoKxaBjKAzAhgGwM4FMA0IB7KAbRABYA2ADgGYB2CkAXXwAcAXKEAZXYCcAlgDsA5iAC%2B%2BALQAmeCCSR%2BAVzyESIOE0kgpNeYpVqikUmAAMzcdaA), preferably just 250 grams, which is more than enough.
    
     -  [Structural Support 3D Printer Filaments](https://www.mcmaster.com/3d-printer-filaments/structural-support-3d-printer-filaments/)
     -  [Ultimaker PVA material: Water-soluble support for complex prints](https://ultimaker.com/materials/pva)
     -  [Ultimaker Breakaway material: Easy-to-remove support material for dual extrusion](https://ultimaker.com/materials/breakaway)
    
 -  Recommended: One or more good-quality crafting/hobby knives with a forward-facing cutting edge (e.g., that of an [*X-Acto*](https://www.xacto.com/knives-blades.html) *#18* blade) to help remove prints from the *print bed*.
    
 -  Recommended: One or more good-quality crafting/hobby knives with a slanted cutting edge (e.g., that of an [*X-Acto*](https://www.xacto.com/knives-blades.html) *#2*, *#11*, *#19*, or *#24* blade) to help remove prints from the *print bed*, and help touch them up afterward.
    
 -  Recommended: One or more pairs of tweezers, to help clean the *extruder nozzles* of the 3D printer.
    
 -  Recommended: A set of hex keys, to disassemble and reassemble the filament *feeders* before and after cleaning/clearing them.
    
 -  Optional: One or more compressed air canisters used for dusting, to clean most of the 3D printer (and workspace) of filament dust and stray pieces, during and after printing.
    
 -  Nice-to-have: A shop supply of compressed air, to clean most of the 3D printer (and workspace) of filament dust and stray pieces, during and after printing.

    *Note:* Compressed air lines are at very high pressures, much higher than that of a compressed air canister. Test their force a meter from the 3D printer first. Failure to do so may damage the more delicate parts of the printer.

    **Caution:** Compressed air lines are at very high pressures. Always wear safety goggles when working with a compressed air line. Never point its nozzle at yourself or others. Failure to do so may result in bodily harm.
    
 -  Optional: [*Scotch blue*](https://www.scotchblue.com/3M/en_US/scotchblue/) or similar tape, to form a layer on the *print bed* for making prints stick to it better during fabrication, while making it easier to remove afterward.
