# Equipment and Materials

 -  A 250-gram spool of regular 3D printing filament.
    
 -  A 250-gram spool of conductive 3D printing filament.

 -  Nice-to-have: A 250-gram spool of dissolvable or "breakaway" 3D printing filament.

 -  A 3D printer.
    
    Minimum requirements:
    
     -  A 3D printer with two extruders ("dual extrusion" capability), to print both regular and conductive material.
    
    Recommended: 
    
     -  A *cartesian* 3D printer (as opposed to a *delta* 3D printer), to make printing more consistent throughout the *print volume* and easier to predict in general.
    
    Nice-to-have's:
    
     -  A 3D printer with even more than two extruders, to also print dissolvable or "breakaway" material for 'scaffolding' prints above the *build plate*.
        
     -  An [Ultimaker-brand 3D printer](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers).* All Ultimaker-brand 3D printers are cartesian 3D printers.
        
         -  An [*Ultimaker 3* (or *Ultimaker 3 Extended*)](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers/ultimaker-3), as used in our project development.
         -  An [*Ultimaker S3*](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers/ultimaker-s3), the sucessor to the *Ultimaker 3*.
        
     -  More than one 3D printer:
        
         -  More than one of the same make & model, to more quickly test print settings, test designs, and create complete devices -- get up and running faster.
         -  More than one of different models, to try them out and similarly get up and running faster at the cost of less consistency and predictability.

 -  Recommended: Tweezers, to help clean the *extruder nozzles* of the 3D printer.

 -  Recommended: A good-quality crafting/hobby knife with a forward-facing cutting edge -- such as that of an [*X-Acto*](https://www.xacto.com/knives-blades.html) *#18* blade -- to help remove prints from the *print bed*.
    
 -  Recommended: A good-quality crafting/hobby knife with a slanted cutting edge -- such as that of an [*X-Acto*](https://www.xacto.com/knives-blades.html) *#2*, *#11*, *#19*, or *#24* blade -- to help remove prints from the *print bed*, and help clean them afterward.
    
 -  Optional: One or more compressed air canisters used for dusting, to clean the 3D printer (and workspace) of filament dust and stray pieces.
    
 -  Nice-to-have: A shop supply of compressed air, to clean the 3D printer (and workspace) of filament dust and stray pieces.

    | Compressed air lines are at very high pressures, much higher than that of a compressed air canister. Test their force a meter from the 3D printer first. Failure to do so may damage the more delicate parts of the printer. |

    | Compressed air lines are at very high pressures. Always wear safety goggles when working with a compressed air line. Never point its nozzle at yourself or others. Failure to do so may result in bodily harm. |
    
 -  Optional: [*Scotch blue*](https://www.scotchblue.com/3M/en_US/scotchblue/) or similar tape, to form a layer on the *print bed* for making prints stick to it better during fabrication, while making it easier to remove afterward.
