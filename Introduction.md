Please read and understand all information presented in this manual prior to attempting to print a Pithon sensor. Failure to adhere to the procedures outlined in this documentation may lead to personal injury, poor quality, or non-functional sensors, or damage to the 3D printer or other equipment. All operators using a 3D printer to manufacture any aspect of Pithon must be well trained in the use of their 3D printer and follow the manufacturer's specifications and guidelines. Pithon sensors, structures, and parts must not be left unattended while printing. Monti does not assume responsibility for any loss, injury, or damage arising from the production or use of any Pithon sensor. Pithon is not intended for use in safety critical applications; use at your own risk.

All information provided within this manual has been gathered from reliable sources and internal development, however Monti provides no warranty of the correctness of any information provided in this manual.

# Warranty Information #

## Hazards ##

### Manufacturing Hazards ###

Manufacturing hazards are as follows.

​ \
Improperly installed 3D printers may present a risk of electrocution. Ensure the 3D printer is installed and operated as per the Manufacturer's specification as described in the 3D printer's User Manual.

​ \
3D printers have nozzles that reach temperatures above 200°C, and some models have heated print beds. Refer to your 3D printer's User Manual on how to operate the device safely.

​ \
3D printers have multiple moving parts, that may damage objects or body parts caught in their motion. Always operate 3D printer as specified in their User Manual.

​ \
3D printing filaments may release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the printing process. VOCs can cause symptoms including headache, fatigue, and confusion. Follow all safety precautions outlined in the material safety data sheet (MSDS) and your 3D printer's User Manual.

### Operating Hazards ###

Operating hazards are as follows.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keeganmjgreen/3D-Printed-Sensors-Manual-Demo/main/img/Safety/ISO_7010_W012.svg" alt="Electricity hazard" style="zoom:20%;" /> \
​ \
Laboratory-grade power sources can generate power sufficient to cause electrocution. Always operate power sources and measurement equipment as per manufacturer's specifications.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keeganmjgreen/3D-Printed-Sensors-Manual-Demo/main/img/Safety/ISO_7010_W017.svg" alt="Hot surface" style="zoom:20%;" /> \
​ \
When applying a larger power, above Pithon's rated voltage and current limits, the sensor may self-heat to high temperatures. Do not handle or touch any part of the Pithon sensor when applying a high voltage or current. \
