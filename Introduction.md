Please read and understand all information presented in this manual prior to attempting to print a Pithon sensor. Failure to adhere to the procedures outlined in this document may lead to personal injury, poor quality or non-functional sensors, or damage to the 3D printer and other equipment. All operators using a 3D printer to manufacture any aspect of Pithon must be well trained in the use of their 3D printer and follow the manufacturer's specifications and guidelines. Pithon sensors, structures or parts must not be left unattended while printing. Monti does not assume responsibility for any loss, injury, or damage arising from the production or use of any Pithon sensor. Pithon is not intended for use in safety critical applications, use at your own risk.

3D printing filaments may release Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) during the printing process. VOCs can cause symptoms including headache, fatigue and confusion. Follow all safety percautions outlined in the material's Data Sheet and your 3D printer's User Manual.


### Operating Hazards ###

When applying a larger power, above Pithon's rated voltage and current limits, the sensor may self-heat to high temperatures. Do not handle or touch any part of the Pithon sensor when applying a high voltage or current.
